<!-- Writing Clean Code -->

<!-- 1. Revise Your Logic Before Coding-->

<!-- Use of flow diagrams or written psuedo code-->

<!-- 2. Clearly Expose the Structure of the Page-->

<!-- for example:-->

<div id="main-container">
    <div id="header">
        <div id="logo">...</div>
        <div id="main-menu">...</div>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
        <div id="left-column">...</div>
 
        <div id="center-column">...</div>
        <div id="right-column">...</div>
    </div>
    <div id="footer">
        <div id="footer-menu">...</div>
        <div id="disclaimer">...</div>
    </div>
</div>

<!--DIV containers that are concretely named after their destined content-->


<!-- 3. Use the Correct Indentation-->

<!-- 4.. Write Explanatory Comments
Should be exact and straight to the point-->

<!-- 5. Avoid Abusing Comments
comments should only reveal the current code functionality-->

<!--Examples of good comment use are:

Authoring specifications (e.g. /* Coded by John, November 13th 2010 */).
Detailed statements on the functionality of a method or procedure (e.g. /* This function validates the login form with the aid of the e-mail check function */).
Quick notifications or labels that state where a recent change was made (e.g. /* Added e-mail validation procedure */).-->

<!-- 6. Avoid Extremely Large Functions
Break them up!
-->

<!--7. Use Naming standards for functions and variables
eg. userName or getNum()
-->

<!--8.Treat Changes with Caution
-keep correct indentations
-comment on the modifications made
-respecting standards in use
-->

<!--9. Avoid Indiscriminate mix of Coding Languages
have appropriate divisions between different coding languages-->

<!--10. Summarize Your Imports
Each imported file is an HTTP requrest that tampers the performance of your application, therefore only have the least amount of imports -->



<!--Coding with Comments-->

<!--Always right your code as if comments do not exist-->
